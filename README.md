This is a very simple Magic 8-Ball program. It lets users input their name, a question, and generates a random response. It has code for either Switch Statements or Else If.

The main reason for this app being on my GitHub is because a modified version will be used on my Portfolio. That version will simply let users click the 8 Ball, and it will randomly return a link to one of my other projects. This standalone version is just a fun little one which will be linked to that one, incase anyone wants to fool around with it.

Right now the CSS and HTML isn't set-up. That, a slight modification of the JavaScript, and 8 projects worth showing off, is about all it needs to be complete.
